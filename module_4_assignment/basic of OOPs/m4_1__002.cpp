what is  oops ?
	oops stands for object oriented programming
	object oriented programming is about creating objects that contains data/properties and function/methods
	
	
list of oops concepts
	1 Class 	- prototype of object
	
	2 Object	- an object is an intance of a class
	
	3 Encapsulation	-Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class, to control access and ensure data integrity.
	
	4 Abstraction	-Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object, allowing for simplified and more focused interaction.
	
	5 Polymorphism 	-Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type through a unified interface.
	
	6 Inheritance	-Inheritance enables a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, fostering code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship.
	
	7 Dynamic Binding	-Dynamic Binding refers to the mechanism where the function call is resolved at runtime, allowing flexibility in selecting the appropriate function based on the actual type of the object.
	
	8 Message Passing	-Message Passing involves communication between objects by sending and receiving messages, facilitating interaction and collaboration in a program.
