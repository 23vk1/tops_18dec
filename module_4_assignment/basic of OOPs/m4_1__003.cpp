/*
diffenrence between OOP and POP

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming) are two different programming paradigms with distinct approaches to organizing and structuring code.

1).	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
	Key Concept: Organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes, and focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
	
	Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods that operate on the data within a class, controlling access and ensuring data integrity.
	
	Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship.
	
	Polymorphism: Enables objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type through a unified interface.


2).	Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP):
	Key Concept: Organizes code around procedures or functions, with an emphasis on routines and procedures to accomplish tasks.
	
	Functions: Focuses on breaking down the program into a set of functions, which are sequences of instructions executed in order.
	
	Data: Data is typically organized into data structures, and functions operate on this data.
	
	No Inherent Concept of Objects: Lacks the concepts of classes and objects, and there is no inherent support for encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism.



Main Differences:
	Organization: OOP organizes code around objects and their interactions, while POP organizes code around procedures and functions.
	
	Abstraction: OOP provides a higher level of abstraction with the use of classes and objects, promoting modularity and reusability. POP focuses more on procedures and routines.
	
	Data and Functions: OOP bundles data and functions into classes, emphasizing encapsulation. In POP, data and functions are typically separate, with a focus on procedures.
	
	Inheritance and Polymorphism: OOP supports inheritance and polymorphism, facilitating code reuse and flexibility. POP does not inherently provide these concepts.


summary
(OOP is centered around objects, offering a more modular and extensible approach, while POP is centered around procedures and functions, emphasizing a step-by-step execution of tasks. The choice between OOP and POP often depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the preferred programming paradigm.)
